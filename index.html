	<h1>TPP Pokemon Naming Keyboard!</h1>
	<p>Do you wish TPP would name <em>your</em> pokemon? Well, here's your chance!</p>
	<h2>To use:</h2>
	<p>Open up your TwitchPlaysPokemon Twitch chat (this has only been tested with the popout chat, so if it fails to work, pop out the chat).</p>
	<p>In the url bar, paste the following code (or use it as a bookmarklet):</p>
	<pre>javascript:(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='http://tustin2121.github.io/TPPNamingKeyboard/pkmn_keyboard.js';})();</pre>
	<p>If you cannot make it work by pasting or as a bookmark, scroll down and see instructions on how to use the Developer Console of your browser.</p>
<!--	<p>Or! Drag the following image onto the chat!</p>
	<a id="pkmnKeyboard" style="display:block;" href="javascript://(function(){document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='http://tustin2121.github.io/TPPNamingKeyboard/pkmn_keyboard.js';})();"></a>-->
	<p>Click on the naming window that appears in the top corner! The keyboard pulls commands out of the chat stream and converts it into the appropriate inputs on the keyboard!</p>
	<p>To mitigate the effects of the "Running" combo on naming, all "B+Direction" commands are collapsed to simply "direction" commands. All combos beyond that are collapsed to only the first command in a combo.</p>
	<h3>Enjoy!</h3>
	
	<div style="clear:both;"></div>
	
	<h2>Developer Console Option</h2>
	<p>If for whatever reason, pasting the URL does not work or causes the page to load a different page, and the bookmark option is not desirable, you can past the following code into the developer console of your browser. Please check the instructions for each browser if you don't know how to do this.</p>
	<pre>document.body.appendChild(document.createElement('script')).src='http://tustin2121.github.io/TPPNamingKeyboard/pkmn_keyboard.js';</pre>
